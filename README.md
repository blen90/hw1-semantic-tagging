# hw1-semantic-tagging
## My task

My task in this homework was refactor some code to change the semantic tags on the html without affecting the formatting that was used in the css stylesheet. 

I changed a few tags related to header, navigation bar, section, aside and footer and I also tried to organize the structure in a way that was easier to understand what section is which by using comments.
