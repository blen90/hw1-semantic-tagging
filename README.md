# Semantic Tagging

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)]()

# Description

The task for this app was to refactor code that was provided to me. Some of the functionality of the app was not working, so I had to make some changes to make sure the app worked properly by changing the semantic tags on the HTML file without affecting the format of the CSS file.
